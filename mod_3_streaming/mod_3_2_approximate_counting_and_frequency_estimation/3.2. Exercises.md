## Exercise 2: The Tidemark algorithm
### Problem
The purpose of the following exercises is to walk you through part of the proof in section 2.3 of the book.
#### Part 1
Describe the indicator variables $X_{r,j}$ and $Y_r$ in your own words.
#### Part 2
Calculate $\mathbb E[X_{r,j}]$ and $\mathbb E[Y_r]$. You may use the fact that $h$ is uniform. Does $\mathbb E[X_{r,j}]$ depend on $j$, on $r$, or both?
#### Part 3
Show that $P[Y_r\ge1]\le\dfrac d{2^r}$.
#### Part 4
Show that for any random variable $X$, $\text{Var}[X]\le\mathbb E[X^2]$.
#### Part 5
Show that $\text{Var}[Y_r]\le\dfrac d{2^r}$. You may use linearity of variance (this is applicable since the $X_{r,j}$-variables are $2$-independent).
#### Part 6
Use Chebyshev to show that $P[Y_r=0]\le\dfrac{2^r}d$.

## Exercise 3: Counting rare elements
### Problem
Paul goes fishing. There are $u$ different fish species $U=\{1,\ldots, u\}$. Paul catches one fish at a time. Let $a_t$ be the fish species he catches at time $t$. Let $c_t[j]=|\{a_i|a_i=j,i\le t\}|$ be the number of times he catches a fish of species $j$ up to time $t$. Species $j$ is rare at time $t$ if it appears precisely once in his catch up to time $t$. The rarity $\rho[t]$ of his catch at time $t$ is defined as:
$$\rho(t)=\dfrac{\#\text{ rare species}}{u}$$
#### Part 1
Explain how Paul can calculate $\rho(t)$ precisely, using $2u+\log(m)$ bits of space.
#### Part 2
However, Paul wants to store only as many bits as will fit his tiny suitcase, i.e., $o(u)$, preferably $O(1)$ bits.
Therefore, Paul picks $k$ random fish species each independently, randomly with probability $1/u$ at the beginning and maintains the numbers of times each of these fish species appear in his bounty, as he catches fish one after another. Paul outputs the estimate:
$$\hat\rho(t)=\dfrac{\#\text{ rare species in the sample}}{k}$$
Let $c_1(t),\ldots,c_k(t)$ be the value of the counters at time $t$. Show that:
$$P[\hat\rho(t)\ge3\rho]\le\dfrac13$$
