## Exercise 1: Largest numbers
### Problem
Given $m$ numbers from the universe $[n]=\{1,\ldots,n\}$, suppose we want to find the $k$ largest
#### Part 1

## Exercise 2: Missing numbers
### Problem
#### Part 1
Assume you get $n-1$ different integers from the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ in a stream. Can you deduce the missing number using only $O(\log(n))$ space?
#### Part 2
Assume now you only get $n-2$ different integers from the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ in a stream. Can you deduce the missing numbers using only $O(\log(n))$ space?

## Exercise 3: Reservoir sampling
### Problem
Here $\text{Random}(a)$ is a random number generator that uniformly at random returns an integer between $1$ and $a$ (both included). At the end of the algorithm, the variable $l$ stores the length of the input stream $S$; this number is not known to the algorithm in advance. If $S$ is empty, the output of the algorithm is correctly undefined. In the following, consider an arbitrary non-empty input stream $S$, and let $m$ denote the unknown length of $S$.
```
proc get_one_sample(S):
	l = 0
	while S is not empty:
		x = next item in S
		l++
		if random(l) = 1:
			sample = x (*)
	
	return sample
```
#### Part 1
Prove that the item returned by $\texttt{GetOneSample}(S)$ is chosen uniformly at random from $S$
#### Part 2
What is the expected value of $l$ when $\texttt{GetOneSample}(S)$ executes line $(*)$ for the last time?
#### Part 3
What is the expected number of times that $\texttt{GetOneSample}(S)$ executes line $(*)$ for the last time or the algorithm ends (whichever happens first)?
#### Part 4
What is the expected number of times that $\texttt{GetOneSample}(S)$ executes line $(*)$ for the second last time or the algorithm ends (whichever happens first)?
#### Part 5
Describe and analyze an algorithm that returns a subset of $k$ items chosen uniformly at random from a data stream of length at least $k$. The integer $k$ is given as part of the input to your algorithm. Prove that your algorithm is correct.
For example, if $k=2$ and the stream contains the sequence $(1,2,3,4)$, the algorithm should return the subset $\{3,1\}$ with probability $\dfrac16$.
