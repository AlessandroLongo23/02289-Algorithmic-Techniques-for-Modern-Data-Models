## Exercise 3.3.3: Range queries #toSolve
### Problem
In this exercise we will use the tree of dyadic intervals to give a sketch for range queries. We maintain a separate CountMin sketch for each level in the tree, where for level $j$ the $j$-th CountMin sketch treats two elements that fall into the same interval in level $j$ as the same element. For all intervals $i$ in the tree, let $C(i)$ denote the value that the appropriate CountMin sketch returns for $i$.
#### Part 1
Show that any interval in the range from $1$ to $n$ can be expressed as the disjoint union $I$ of at most $2\log_2(n)$ dyadic intervals. Use the tree.
#### Part 2
Explain how to use $I$ to return an estimate for the range query $\text{range}(a,b)$.
#### Part 3
We want to have an additive error of at most $\epsilon m$ as in the original CountMin sketch. Let $f_{[a,b]}$ be the total frequency of the elements in the range $[a,b]$. Show that if we set $w=\dfrac{2\log_2(n)}\epsilon$ in all the CountMin sketches, then the expected error is $\epsilon m$, that is:
$$\mathbb E\left[\sum_{i\in I}C(i)\right]\le f_{[a,b]}+\epsilon m$$
#### Part 4
What is the total space and query time? We will use $d=\log_2\left(\dfrac1\delta\right)$

## Exercise 3.3.5: Idea behind CountSketch #solved #toTranscribe
### Problem
Consider the following simple algorithm for finding estimates of all $f_i$.
Let $s$ be a pairwise independent hash function from $[n]$ to $\{-1,1\}$ and let $c$ be a counter. While processing the stream, each time we encounter an item $i$, update the counter $c=c+s[i]$. When answering a query, we return $\hat f_i=c\cdot s[i]$.
#### Part 1
Compute the expected value of $s[j]$ for $j\in[n]$
#### Part 2
Show that $\hat f_i=f_i+\sum_{j\ne i}f_j\cdot s[j]\cdot s[i]$
#### Part 3
For two independent random variables $X$ and $Y$ we have $\mathbb E[XY]=\mathbb E[X]\mathbb E[Y]$. Use this and linearity of expectation to show that $\mathbb E[\hat f_i]=f_i$.

The variance of this algorithm is very large and many elements have estimates that are wrong by more than the variance. In the CountSketch algorithm there are $t$ hash functions $h_j:[n]\to[w]$ and $t$ hash functions $s_j:[n]\to\{-1,1\}$ and a $t\times w$ array of counters. The counters in row $j$ are saved in array $C_j$. When an element $q$ arrives, the data structure is updated by setting:
$$C_j[h_j[q]] +=s_j[q]\quad\forall j\in[t]$$
To estimate the frequency of element $q$ return:
$$\text{median}_j\{C_j[h_j[q]]\cdot s_j[q]\}$$

## Exercise 3.3.6: Heavy hitters using a single CountMin sketch #solved #toTranscribe
### Problem
Recall an element $i$ in a stream is a heavy hitter if it has frequency $f_i\gt\dfrac mk$ for some given $k$. We define an infrequent element to be an element with frequency less than $\dfrac m{2k}$.
In this exercise we will use a single CountMin sketch and a binary min heap to get a streaming algorithm that outputs heavy hitters. The goal is to get an algorithm that returns all heavy hitters and, with probability $1-\gamma$, returns no infrequent elements. The algorithm should be space and time efficient.
The algorithm will use a binary min heap to maintain some of the most frequent elements seen so far. Every time an element is encountered, the algorithm updates the CountMin sketch and the heap. By the end of the stream, the algorithm outputs all elements in the heap that has an estimated frequency more than $\dfrac mk$.
#### Part 1
Explain how to update the heap when an element is encountered in the stream to ensure all heavy hitters are output. Remember to argue that your algorithm is correct.
#### Part 2
We want to choose an error probability $\delta$ in the CountMin sketch such that the probability of the algorithm outputting an element with frequency $f_i\lt\left(\dfrac1k-\epsilon\right)m$ is bounded by $\gamma$. Show that this can be obtained by setting $\delta=\dfrac\gamma n$
#### Part 3
We want to ensure that with probability at least $1-\gamma$ the algorithm outputs no infrequent element. Explain how we can obtain this.
#### Part 4
Let $X$ be the number of elements with estimated frequency $\gt\dfrac mk$. Argue that:
$$\mathbb E[X]\le2k+n\gamma$$
What should $\gamma$ be if we want $\mathbb E[X]=O(k)$?
#### Part 5
What is the update time and expected space usage of your algorithm? What is the time complexity for reporting the heavy hitters?
