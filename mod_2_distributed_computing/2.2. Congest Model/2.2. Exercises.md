## Exercise 2.2.1: BFS tree
### Problem
Run the BFS tree algorithm on the graph below. Let $t(v)$ be the round in which $a(v)$ was set to $1$. For each node maintain $d(v)$, $C(v)$, $a(v)$ and $t(v)$. Indicate $p(v)$ by marking the edge from $v$ to $p(v)$. Assume that a node $u$ with $d(u)=\perp$ always accept the proposal from the node with the smallest identifier.

## Exercise 2.2.2: Edge counting
### Problem
The edge counting problem is defined as follows: each node has to output the value $|E|$, i.e., it has to indicate how many edges there are in the graph. Assume that that solves the edge counting problem in the congest model in time $O(\text{diam}(G))$.

## Exercise 2.2.3: Detecting bipartite graphs
### Problem
Assume that the input graph is connected. Design an algorithm that solves the following problem in the congest model in time $O(\text{diam}(G))$: if the input graph is bipartite, all nodes output $1$, otherwise they all output $0$.

## Exercise 2.2.4: Detecting complete graphs
### Problem

## Exercise 2.2.5: MST
### Problem
Design an algorithm that computes a minimum spanning tree in $O(n\log(n))$ rounds in the congest model. Assume the following:
- each edge is an integer polynomial in $n$, allowing it to be sent as a single message
- each node $u$ stores a list of pairs $(w,v)$ where $w$ is the weight of edge $(u,v)$ for each neighbor $v$ of $u$.
