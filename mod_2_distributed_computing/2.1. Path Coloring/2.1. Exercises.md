#### Part 3
Rewrite the algorithm so nodes do not keep sending messages.
### Solution
#### Part 1
See code
#### Part 2
Any decreasing sequence will run in $n$ rounds, since the only local maxima at round $i$ is at position $i$. Analogous for increasing sequence.

## Exercise 2.1.4 #solved #toTranscribe
### Problem
Construct a directed path of 3 nodes that is labeled with unique identifiers (of any size) such that the following holds: After two iterations of the fast color reduction algorithm from Section 1.4.2, the color of the first node is 7.
It is enough to just list the three unique identifiers (in decimal); there is no need to explain anything else.

## Exercise  2.1.5: (1.8.1 from book) C
A maximal independent set is a set of nodes I that satisfies the following properties:
• for each node $v\in I$, none of its neighbors are in $I$,
• for each node $v\notin I$, at least one of its neighbors is in $I$.

Here is an example: the nodes labeled with a $1$ form a maximal independent set:
$$1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1$$
Your task is to design a distributed algorithm that finds a maximal independent set in any path graph, for each of the following settings:
- a deterministic algorithm for paths with arbitrarily large unique identifiers
- a fast deterministic algorithm for directed paths with 128-bit unique identifiers
- a randomized algorithm that does not need unique identifiers

In part (a), use the techniques presented in Section 1.3, in part (b),
use the techniques presented in Section 1.4, and in part (c), use the
techniques presented in Section 1.5.

## Exercise 2.1.6: (1.8.3 from book) #toSolve
### Problem
The fast $3$-coloring algorithm from Section 1.4 finds a $3$-coloring very fast in any directed path. Design an algorithm that is almost as fast and works in any path, even if the edges are not directed. You can assume that the range of identifiers is known.

## Exercise 2.1.7: (1.8.5 from book)
### Problem
Analyze the fast $3$-coloring algorithm from Section 1.4:
- Assume that we are given a coloring with x colors; the colors are numbers from $\{1,2,\ldots,x\}$. Show that we can find a $3$-coloring in time $O(\log^*(x))$.
- Assume that we are given unique identifiers that are polynomial in $n$, that is, there is a constant $c=O(1)$ such that the unique identifiers are a subset of $\{1,2,\ldots,n^c\}$. Show that we can find a $3$-coloring in time $O(\log^*(n))$.

## Exercise 2.1.8
### Problem
Assume the network is connected.
#### Part 1
Give an algorithm in the local model that ensures that after $O(\text{diam}(G))$ rounds every node in the network knows everything about the graph $G$.
#### Part 2
Explain how this algorithm can be used to solve any graph problem for which there's a non-distributed algorithm in $O(\text{diam}(G))$ rounds in the local model.
#### Part 3
Give an example of a graph where this algorithm doesn't work in the congest model.
