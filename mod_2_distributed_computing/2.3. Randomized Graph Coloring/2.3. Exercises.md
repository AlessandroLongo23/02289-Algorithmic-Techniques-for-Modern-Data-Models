## Exercise 1: Larger Palette
### Problem
Assume that we have a graph without any isolated nodes. We will design a graph-coloring algorithm $\mathcal A$ that is a bit easier to understand and analyze than the algorithm of section 6.4. In algorithm $\mathcal A$, each node $u$ proceeds as follows until it stops:
- node $u$ picks a color $c(u)$ from $\{1,2,\ldots,2d\}$ uniformly at random: here $d$ is the degree of node $u$
- node $u$ compares its value $c(u)$ with the values of all neighbors. If $c(u)$ is different from the values of its neighbors, $u$ outputs $c(u)$ and stops

Analyze the algorithm, and prove that it finds a $2\Delta$-coloring in time $O(\log(n))$ w.h.p.
### Solution

## Exercise 2: Unique identifiers
### Problem
Design a randomized PN algorithm $\mathcal A$ that solves the following problem in $O(1)$ rounds:
- as input, all nodes get value $|V|$
- algorithm $\mathcal A$ outputs a labeling $f:V\to\{1,\ldots,x\}$ for some $x=|V|^{O(1)}$
- w.h.p., f(u)\ne f(v)$ for all nodes $u\ne v$

Analyze your algorithm and prove that it indeed solves the problem correctly.
```ad-Nota
title: Note
In essence, algorithm $\mathcal A$ demonstrates that we can use randomness to construct unique identifiers, assuming that we have some information on the size of the network. Hence, we can take any algorithm $\mathcal B$ designed for the local model, and combine it with algorithm $\mathcal A$ to obtain a PN algorithm $\mathcal B'$ that solves the same problem as $\mathcal B$ w.h.p.

## Exercise 3: Large Independent sets
### Problem
Design a randomized PN algorithm $\mathcal A$ with the following guarantee: in any graph $G=(V,E)$ of maximum degree $\Delta$, algorithm $\mathcal A$ outputs an independent set $I$ such that the expected size of $I$ is $\dfrac{|V|}{O(\Delta)}$. The running time of the algorithm should be $O(1)$. You can assume that all nodes know $\Delta$.

## Exercise 4: Max cut problem
### Problem
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph. A cut is a function $f:V\to\{0,1\}$. An edge $\{u,v\}\in E$ is a cut edge in $f$ if $f(u)\ne f(v)$. The size of cut $f$ is the number of cut edges, and a maximum cut is a cut of the largest possible size. Prove that:
- if $G=(V,E)$ is a bipartite graph, then a maximum cut has $|E|$ edges
- if $G=(V,E)$ has a cut with $|E|$ edges, then $G$ is bipartite

## Exercise 5: Max cut algorithm
### Problem
Design a randomized PN algorithm $\mathcal A$ with the following guarantee: in any graph $G=(V,E)$, algorithm $\mathcal A$ outputs a cut $f$ such that the expected size of cut $f$ is at least $\dfrac{|E|}2$. The running time of the algorithm should be $O(1)$.
The analysis of the algorithm $\mathcal A$ also implies that for any graph there exists a cut of size at least $\dfrac{|E|}2$.

## Exercise 7
### Problem
Consider a cycle with $10$ nodes, and label the nodes with a random permutation of the numbers $1,2,\ldots,10$ (uniformly at random). A node is a local maximum if its label is larger than the labels of its two neighbors. Let $X$ be the number of local maxima. What is the expected value of $X$?
