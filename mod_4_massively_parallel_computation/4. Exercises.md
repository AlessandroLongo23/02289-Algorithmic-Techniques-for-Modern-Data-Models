## Exercise 4.1: Broadcast Tree #solved #toTranscribe
### Problem
Let $S=N^\epsilon$ and suppose some machine, call it machine $1$, wants to send a message of size $m=O(\sqrtS)=O(N^{\epsilon/2})$ to all other machines. In the first round it sends the message to $k=\dfrac Sm=\Theta(\sqrt S)$ other machines. In the second round, those machines send the message to a total of $k^2$ new machines, and so on. This induces a $k$-ary tree, called a broadcast tree, on the machines where machine $1$ is the root.
Argue that after $O\left(\dfrac1\epsilon\right)$, the message has reached every machine, and that no machine has sent or received more than $S$ words in any round.

## Exercise 4.2: Converge-Cast Tree #solved #toTranscribe
### Problem
In part 1 of the Sorting algorithm in the slides, every machine counts the number of its element in each set $S_i$. It then sends these counts to machine $1$ which adds them together to compute the sizes of sets $S_i$.
However, if every machine sends its counts directly to machine $1$ in the same round, machine $1$ will receive close to $N$ words in that round, significantly exceeding its space bound of $S=N^\epsilon$.
Show how machine $1$ can obtain the size of each set $S_i$ in $O\left(\dfrac1\epsilon\right)$ rounds such that no machine sends or receives more than $S$ words in any round.

## Exercise 4.4: Sorting #solved #toTranscribe
### Problem
Solve the following exercises.
#### Part 1
Explain why the MPC algorithm for sorting can be viewed as a variant of QuickSort.
#### Part 2
When the MPC sorting algorithm from the slides terminates, each element together with its rank is stored on some machine. This is not quite the format of [2], which requires that each (element, rank)-pair is stored on the machine that initially held that element. Show how to convert the output from the algorithm in the slides to the required format in $O(1)$ additional rounds.
